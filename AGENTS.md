- Authenticate the existing client-only protected layout with getUser before rendering; root identity transitions invalidate routing and sign-out clears query caches to prevent stale private views.
- Preserve sessions through the generated auth client and store only the last email in app storage; passwords belong exclusively to browser credential management.
- Admin diagnostics use authenticated server functions with a stored-role check; never grant roles from login form values or implement arbitrary-password access.

- Keep narration readiness and estimated phrase timing in the browser-safe narration-timeline module; both preview and export use it to avoid silent completion and inconsistent captions.
- Burn Arabic captions using browser-shaped canvas PNGs in the lazy FFmpeg export, because the bundled core does not guarantee Arabic text shaping or font filters.
- Preserve selected voice settings in generator project data and overlap speech generation with the existing single-video queue, avoiding duplicate video requests.
- The client advertising form saves its brief and logo into an owned generator project and uses the existing generator flow; do not represent a quoted price as a completed payment without a verified payment service.
